# Technical Skills

## Could you describe which technical topic you had most trouble with?

I was familiar with Git version control , html , css and JavaScript ,so I didn't face serious trouble with these technical topics , but I dealt with the ordinary issues while solving assignments ,for example while playing git-game , in some level I need to understand the difference between the tag and the branch in order to fix this issue ,also while solving the Pokedex technical assignment when using Materialize CSS local set up , the material icons where not working properly so I use the CDN link instead .
