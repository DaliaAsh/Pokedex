# Git Game FeedBack

while playing this game I learned a lot of git commands like :

## git --version

to know the git version you install

## git init

used to initialize a folder as git repository

## git add .

to stage all files and move them from the working area into the index

## git commit

move the files from the index area into the repository area

## git clone URL

to clone a remote repository

## git branch branch_name

to create a branch

## git branch -a

to list all branches in the remote and local

## git remote add origin <URLFROMGITHUB>

to add a remote on your repository

also I learned the difference between tag and branch

## git diff branch1 branch2

to get the differences between two branches

## git pull

to move changes from remote to local = git fetch + git merge

# Branch vs Tag

## branch will change when new commit happens

## tag will not change when new commit happens (used for stable version )

### The tag is more like the stable release. While the branch is more like the in progress feature, which will be added soon.
